# Team norms

## Team values

- We will all work separately on assigned tasks and reconvene on roadblocks in our weekly Wednesday 9 p.m. meetings
- Members who need help will reach out to the group on the Discord channel and if necessary ask for help from the tutor or professor
- In case there are disagreements we will each listen to others' opinions and then do a majority vote
- If a member is failing to deliver on their obligations we will contact them to check in and see what the issues are and if deemed necessary involve the professor
- Members are expected to respond to messages within a day of receiving them 

## Sprint cadence

- Each sprint will take about 2 weeks

## Daily standups

- Standups will occur every Wednesday at 9 pm and last for 1 hour in addition to the ones we do during class time
- All members are expected to come to Wednesday meetings and present synchronously unless they are excused at least 24 hours in advance
- Members will not cover the responsibilities for each other, each is responsible for their own tasks and deliverables
- If a member is making no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to the professor

## Coding standards

- All members will use Visual Studio Code to ensure standardized code formatting. 
- Do not over-engineer; write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve.
- Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once we learn how to do that).

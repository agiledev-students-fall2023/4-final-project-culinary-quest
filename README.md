## Short History
A passion project started by Anna, the idea was born from her time as a struggling college student working with limited ingredients and limited time. Seeing a golden opportunity to develop her vision, she sprung into action, shooting her shot, and bestowing her dream upon the world.

Please contribute in any way you'd like, particularly focusing on any issues that have been raised.

## Build & Run Instructions
The steps to build and run the webapp are as follows:

1. Using your built-in terminal, navigate to the repo folder.
2. Navigate into the ```back-end``` folder.
3. Start the back end by running ```npx nodemon server```; it should now be running on ```localhost://3001```. If an error occurs, try running ```npm install``` to ensure all dependency packages are installed.
4. After confirming the back end is running, navigate into the ```front-end``` folder.
5. Start the front end by running ```npm start```; it should now be running on ```localhost://3000```. If an error occurs, try running ```npm install``` first to ensure all dependencies are present.
6. Done.

### Error and Bug Reporting
Most issues that arise tend to occur when running the commands to build the front and back ends. This is usually the result of missing dependencies and can be resolved by running ```npm install```. If not, attempt to install the missing dependencies manually via ```npm install "missing_dep_name"```.

If it still fails to run, or another issue has arisen, please create an issue marked with the tag ```bug```.
